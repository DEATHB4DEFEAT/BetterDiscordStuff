# BetterDiscordStuff
Things I made to use with BetterDiscord.

## DeveloperMode
> Once activated, close settings if it is open and reopen it. You should be able to see some new options at the bottom that you can mess around with.

> If you want to disable the extra options you can disable the plugin and reload discord. **THIS WON'T UNDO CHANGES TO THE OPTIONS**.
